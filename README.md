Udavin Wijesundara - Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio website built with Create React App, showcasing my work as a Full Stack Developer. The site highlights my skills, projects, experience, and education, with a modern and responsive design optimized for both light and dark themes. It includes features like smooth scrolling, a custom cursor, a mobile-friendly navigation menu, and a stylish "Scroll to Top" button.
Features

Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices with a mobile-friendly navigation menu.
Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between dark and light themes for better user experience.
Interactive Navigation: Smooth scrolling to sections with active section highlighting.
Custom Cursor: A dynamic cursor effect that enhances user interaction.
Scroll to Top Button: A modern, animated button with a gradient design and glassmorphism effect, appearing after scrolling 300 pixels.
Project Showcase: Displays featured projects with images, descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos.
SEO Optimization: Includes meta tags and structured data (Schema.org) for better search engine visibility.
Contact Section: Links to social media and email for easy communication.
Animated UI: Subtle animations (e.g., gradient shifts, floating elements, pulse effects) using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.

Technologies Used

React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
Framer Motion: For smooth animations and transitions.
Lucide React: Icon library for modern, customizable icons.
React Helmet: For SEO optimization and meta tag management.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Core web technologies for structure and interactivity.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (comes with Node.js)

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/udavinw/portfolio.git


Navigate to the project directory:
cd portfolio


Install dependencies:
npm install



Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and lint errors will appear in the console.
npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the Create React App documentation on running tests for more details.
npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for caching. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the deployment documentation for more information.
npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
Ejects the app from Create React App, copying all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control. Use this if you need to customize the build setup. All commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts.
